# FPL-Data-Visualisation

Gameweek 1 data from the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) game is used to produce data visualisation using the Seaborn library. This is to aid decision making and strategy calls for future gameweeks. Using Seaborn, which is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib, barplots, scatter plots and histograms were created to display data in order to gain a better understanding of this data. All data used was obtained from the 'Fantasy-Premier-League' repository, owned by @vaastav.
