# FPL-Data-Visualisation
Gameweek 1 data from the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) game is used to produce data visualisation using the Seaborn library. This is to aid decision making and strategy calls for future gameweeks. Using Seaborn, which is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib, barplots, scatter plots and histograms were created to display data in order to gain a better understanding of this data. All data used was obtained from the 'Fantasy-Premier-League' repository, owned by @vaastav. 

## Bar Plots

### Highest Point Scorers
This bar chart displays the players who scored the highest amount of points in GW1. Scoring points is crucial in FPL, these players who scored highly in GW1 will be in high demand for GW2 and future gameweeks. Python Code: [highest_scorers.py](https://github.com/stephenpower2003/FPL-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/highest_scorers.py)

### Most Saves
This bar chart displays the goalkeepers with the most amount of saves in GW1. A goalkeeper is awarded a single point for every 3 saves made, meaning that the goalkeeper's who racked up a large number of saves will be popular options for the goalkeeper slot within teams. Python Code: [highest_saves.py](https://github.com/stephenpower2003/FPL-Data-Visualisation/blob/main/highest_saves.py)
